1. At the beginning, I created the room and room id attributes for reservation and forgot that a reservation can have muliple rooms. Then it took me a while to change the data type of rooms and room_ids to array. So think carefully about the data type for each attribute, which can decrease the changes in the future.
2. More readable variable names.
3. More reliable test cases. Not a lot of edge cases were tested.
4. Less repeat of code. More DRY. For example, repeating several times of validating the integers.
